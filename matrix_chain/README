Matrix chain file format reading / writing routines in Python / Matlab.

The file format is:
M1,M2,M3,...

Where each Mk stream consists of 1) a header and 2) the data. 

1) 
The header consists of two ints and a char:
R,C,[data type specifier character]

2)
The data format consist of RxC values (in row-major format) of the type specified by the data type specified character:
[d11]...[d1C]
...
[dR1]...[dRC]

Valid data type specifiers characters are (using the numpy character specifier convention):
  f,d: 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point.
  i,I: 32-bit signed and unsigned integers.
  b,B: 8-bit signed and unsigned integers.
